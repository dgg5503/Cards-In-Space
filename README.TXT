This is a very primitive game a couple of friends and I had made for our AP Computer Science final. At the time it seemed like things were going well but we hadn't put much time into the design phase in terms of both gameplay and structure. This resulted in messy code but it worked out in the end! I had so much fun working with my closest friends on this project with my friends that I can't wait to do it again in the real world hopefully with more organization next time :).
